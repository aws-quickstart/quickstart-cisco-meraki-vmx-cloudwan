This deployment is not a {partner-product-short-name} warm spare configuration. It requires you to have at least two {partner-product-short-name} licenses. If your organization has already reached its license limit, you cannot create new {partner-product-short-name} networks until a {partner-product-short-name} network is deleted or additional licenses are added.

If you do not have access to a {partner-product-short-name} license or require additional {partner-product-short-name} licenses, reach out to your Meraki https://locatr.cloudapps.cisco.com/WWChannels/LOCATR/openBasicSearch.do[reseller^] or sales representative.
