//Include any predeployment steps here, such as signing up for a Marketplace AMI or making any changes to a partner account. If there are no predeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Predeployment steps

This Quick Start assumes familiarity with the https://documentation.meraki.com/Getting_Started[Meraki dashboard^] and setting up a vMX appliance on AWS. For more information, refer to https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)[vMX Setup Guide for Amazon Web Services (AWS)^].

=== Prepare your AWS account

==== Subscribe to the {partner-product-short-name} AMI
This Quick Start requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for {partner-product-short-name} in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. Open the page for the {marketplace_listing_url}[{marketplace_subscription} AMI in AWS Marketplace^], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, refer to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].
. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplaceâ€”the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.

=== Prepare your {partner-product-short-name} account
. Complete the instructions in the *Meraki Dashboard Configuration* section of the https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/MX_Installation_Guides/vMX_Setup_Guide_for_Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)[vMX Setup Guide for Amazon Web Services (AWS)^]. During configuration, you generate authentication tokens for the vMX appliances. Copy and save the tokens. You must enter them in the `vMX1Token` and `vMX2Token` parameters in the AWS CloudFormation console during Quick Start deployment.

. For each template deployed, for both the base and additional Region parameters, set the network tag of vMXn to identify vMX nodes as the primary and secondary hub, respectively. To set network tags in the Meraki dashboard, refer to https://documentation.meraki.com/General_Administration/Organizations_and_Networks/Organization_Menu/Manage_Tags[Manage Tags^].
+
TIP: Perform this step at the global dashboard level, and not on the vMX *Network* tab.

. Configure your branch sites as Meraki Auto VPN spokes with the vMX instances as the primary and secondary hubs. For more information, refer to https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/Site-to-site_VPN/Meraki_Auto_VPN_-_Configuration_and_Troubleshooting[Meraki Auto VPN - Configuration and Troubleshooting^].

.. Add a summary route on each vMX that includes a summary CIDR range of all AWS resources in all Regions. Optionally, you can use multiple CIDRs for non-contiguous addresses.

.. Optionally, advertise the local transit VPC subnet, if needed.
