// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== Verify Cloud WAN resources

. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/states[Step Functions console^], verify that the `CreateStateMachine` and `CreateNetworkNewRegion` APIs ran successfully. These actions run once per template.

. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home#/networks[Network Manager console^], verify that Cloud WAN contains a global network, a core network, and a VPC attachment.

=== Add VPC summary route to Cloud WAN VPC attachment

For the transit VPC to route traffic to your Cloud WAN backbone, you must have one or more routes for the IP address range of your AWS workloads across the various deployed Regions.
. Pick an IP CIDR range that differentiates your AWS resources from your branch and on-premise resources.
. Point the route to the core network's VPC attachment for the transit VPC. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html[Configure route tables^].

. Optionally, add workload VPCs from different Cloud WAN segments into your core network policy. If you have workloads in separate Cloud WAN segments, you can advertise those routes to your Meraki SD-WAN vMXs via the core network policy. For more information, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-cloud-wan-preview/[Introducing AWS Cloud WAN (Preview)^].

=== Deploy transit VPC in a different Region

TIP: Ensure that you are in a different Region than the one used in the original deployment (referred to as the base Region).

. https://fwd.aws/7KzP9?[Deploy the transit VPC in a new Region^]. This template also deploys a polling Lambda function to check and configure additional routes.
. In the upper-right corner of the navigation bar, choose an additional AWS Region that's different from the base Region.
. On the *Create stack* page, keep the default setting for the template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify stack details* page, change the stack name if needed. Review the parameters for the template. Provide values for the parameters that require input. For all other parameters, review the default settings and customize them as necessary. When you finish reviewing and customizing the parameters, choose *Next*.
. On the *Configure stack options* page, you can https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html[specify tags^] (key-value pairs) for resources in your stack and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html[set advanced options^]. When you finish, choose *Next*.
. On the *Review* page, review and confirm the template settings. Under *Capabilities*, select the two check boxes to acknowledge that the template creates IAM resources and might require the ability to automatically expand macros.
. Choose *Create stack* to deploy the stack.
. To view the created resources, see the values displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack.
. Verify that the Cloud WAN resources deployed successfully.

.. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/states[Step Functions console^], verify that the `CreateNetworkNewRegion` API ran successfully. Note that the `CreateStateMachine` does not run because it was already created when you deployed the main Quick Start template.
.. Confirm that a new SD-WAN attachment was created and attached to the additional Region's transit VPC.
. In the https://console.aws.amazon.com/networkmanager/home#/networks[Network Manager console^], verify that Cloud WAN contains a global network, a ccre network, and a VPC attachment.
. Add a VPC summary route to the Cloud WAN VPC attachment by repeating the steps you took earlier for the base Region. At that time, you created a similar summary route from the new transit VPC to the new Cloud WAN VPC attachment.
