This Quick Start helps automate the deployment of {partner-product-short-name}s in multiple AWS Regions along with route propagation and high availability. Using Meraki AutoVPN, you can connect multiple Meraki branch MXs to AWS regional virtual MX (vMX) hubs configured in an active-active pair. All routes learned via AutoVPN are propagated into AWS for a more seamless connectivity from your branch locations to your AWS workloads in any AWS Region. This deployment combines AWS Cloud WAN, Meraki APIs, and a serverless mechanism for distributing routes without using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
